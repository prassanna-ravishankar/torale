# Notifications

Configure when and how you receive notifications.

## Notification Behaviors

**once** - Notify when the condition first becomes true, then pause the task. Use for one-time events like product releases or registration openings.

**always** - Notify every time the condition is met, regardless of previous notifications. Use for price monitoring where you want every update, or stock alerts where availability changes frequently.

## In-App Notifications

View notifications in the dashboard by clicking the bell icon in the header. Notifications show:
- Which task triggered
- When the condition was met
- The answer with reasoning
- Source URLs for verification

## Email Notifications (Coming Soon)

Email delivery with customizable templates and digest mode for daily or weekly summaries.

## Webhook Notifications (Coming Soon)

POST notifications to your webhook URL for integration with other systems.

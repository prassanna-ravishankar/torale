# Dashboard Overview

The Torale dashboard provides a complete interface for creating and managing monitoring tasks.

## Main Sections

**Tasks** - View all your monitoring tasks, create new ones, and manage existing tasks

**Notifications** - See executions where your conditions were met

**Settings** - Manage API keys and account preferences

## Dashboard Layout

The main dashboard shows all your tasks in a sortable table with:
- Task name and status (active/paused)
- Last execution time
- Condition status (met/waiting)
- Quick actions (edit, pause, delete)

## Creating Tasks

Click "New Task" to open the creation wizard with two options:

**Use Template** - Select from pre-configured templates for common monitoring scenarios

**Start from Scratch** - Create a custom task with full control over all parameters

The wizard guides you through:
1. Query configuration
2. Condition definition
3. Schedule setup
4. Preview (optional)
5. Review and create

## Task Status Indicators

**Active** - Task is running on schedule

**Paused** - Task exists but won't execute

**Condition Met** - Your trigger condition was satisfied in the last execution

## Quick Actions

Each task has quick action buttons:
- **Edit** - Modify query, condition, schedule, or notifications
- **Pause/Resume** - Temporarily disable without deleting
- **Execute** - Run immediately for testing
- **Delete** - Remove task permanently
